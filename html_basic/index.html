    <title>My Cool First Webpage</title>

    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is my very first webpage using HTML. I'm excited to start this journey and explore web development more deeply.</p>

    <h2>Why I Love Web Development</h2>
    <p>Web development allows me to bring ideas to life on the internet. I enjoy creating websites that are both functional and visually appealing.</p>

    <h3>What I've Learned So Far</h3>
    <p>I've learned how to structure a webpage using HTML tags like headings, paragraphs, and images. This is just the beginning!</p>

    
    <p>My goal is to become a full-stack web developer. I want to build apps that solve real-world problems and help people.</p>
